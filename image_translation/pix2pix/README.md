# Pix2Pix Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Netwoks

[Pix2Pix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf) network is basically a Conditional GANs (cGAN) that learn the mapping from an input image to output an image. 

Image-To-Image Translation is a process for translating one representation of an image into another representation.

* The Generator Network
  Generator network uses a <b>U-Net</b>-based architecture. U-Net’s architecture is similar to an <b>Auto-Encoder</b> network except for one difference. Both U-Net and Auto-Encoder network has two networks The <b>Encoder</b> and the <b>Decoder</b>.
