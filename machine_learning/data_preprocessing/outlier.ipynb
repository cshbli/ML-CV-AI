    "# Outlier Detection and Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "When modeling, it is important to clean the data sample to ensure that the observations best represent the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a dataset can contain extreme values that are outside the range of what is expected and unlike the other data. These are called outliers and often machine learning modeling can be improved by understanding and even removing these outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier is an observation that is unlike the other observations. It is rare, or distinct, or does not fit in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can have many causes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurement or input error.\n",
    "- Data corruption.\n",
    "- True outlier observation (e.g. Michael Jordan in basketball).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no precise way to define and identify outliers in general because of the specifics of each dataset. Instead, you, or a domain expert, must interpret the raw observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we can use statistical methods to identify observations that appear to be rare or unlikely given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that the values identified are outliers and should be removed."

    "## Standard Deviation Method\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know that the distribution of values in the sample is Gaussian or Gaussian-like, we can use the standard deviation of the sample as a cut-off for identifying outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian distribution has the property that the standard deviation from the mean can be used to reliably summarize the percentage of values in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/normal-distrubution-large.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, within one standard deviation of the mean will cover 68% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can cover more of the data sample if we expand the range as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 Standard Deviation from the Mean: 68%\n",
    "- 2 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 95%\n",
    "- 3 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 99.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "A value that falls outside of 3 standard deviations is part of the distribution, but it is an unlikely or rare event at approximately 1 in 370 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/Standard-Normal-Distribution.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Three standard deviations from the mean is a common cut-off in practice for identifying outliers in a Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution. For smaller samples of data, perhaps a value of 2 standard deviations (95%) can be used, and for larger samples, perhaps a value of 4 standard deviations (99.9%) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the data is `standardized` first (e.g. to a `Z-score` with zero mean and unit variance) so that the outlier detection can be performed using standard Z-score cut-off values. This is a convenience and is not required in general, and we will perform the calculations in the original scale of the data here to make things clear."

    "\n",
    "Not all data is normal or normal enough to treat it as being drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good statistic for summarizing a non-Gaussian distribution sample of data is the Interquartile Range, or IQR for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR is calculated as the difference between the 75th and the 25th percentiles of the data and defines the box in a box and whisker plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that percentiles can be calculated by sorting the observations and selecting values at specific indices. The 50th percentile is the middle value, or the average of the two middle values for an even number of examples. If we had 10,000 samples, then the 50th percentile would be the average of the 5000th and 5001st values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the percentiles as quartiles (“quart” meaning 4) because the data is divided into four groups via the 25th, 50th and 75th values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR defines the middle 50% of the data, or the body of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining limits on the sample values that are a factor k of the IQR below the 25th percentile or above the 75th percentile. The common value for the factor k is the value 1.5. A factor k of 3 or more can be used to identify values that are extreme outliers or “far outs” when described in the context of box and whisker plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a box and whisker plot, these limits are drawn as fences on the whiskers (or the lines) that are drawn from the box. Values that fall outside of these values are drawn as dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the percentiles of a dataset using the percentile() NumPy function that takes the dataset and specification of the desired percentile. The IQR can then be calculated as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles."
