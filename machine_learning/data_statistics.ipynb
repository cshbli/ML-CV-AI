    "# Understanding Data with Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Descriptive statistics</b> is about describing and summarizing data. It uses two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The quantitative approach describes and summarizes data numerically.\n",
    "2. The visual approach illustrates data with charts, plots, histograms, and other graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply descriptive statistics to one or many datasets or variables. \n",
    "- <b>Univariate analysis</b>: When you describe and summarize a single variable, you’re performing univariate analysis. \n",
    "- <b>Bivariate analysis</b>: When you search for statistical relationships among a pair of variables, you’re doing a bivariate analysis. \n",
    "- <b>Mulivariate analysis</b>: A multivariate analysis is concerned with multiple variables at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of measures in descriptive statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Central tendency</b> tells you about the centers of the data. Useful measures include the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "- <b>Variability</b> tells you about the spread of the data. Useful measures include variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "- <b>Correlation or joint variability</b> tells you about the relation between a pair of variables in a dataset. Useful measures include covariance and the correlation coefficient.\n",
