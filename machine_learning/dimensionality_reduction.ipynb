    "## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "PCA, generally called data reduction technique, is very useful feature selection technique as it extracts the most important features from the dataset that are responsible for maximum variance in the output. We can implement PCA feature selection technique with the help of `PCA` class of scikit-learn Python library. We can select number of principal components in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to convert high dimensional data to low dimensional data by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset. The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. The feature that causes highest variance is the first principal component. The feature that is responsible for second highest variance is considered the second principal component, and so on."

    "### Advantages of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main advantages of dimensionality reduction with PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training time of the algorithms reduces significantly with less number of features.\n",
    "- It is not always possible to analyze data in high dimensions. For instance if there are 100 features in a dataset. Total number of scatter plots required to visualize the data would be 100(100-1)2 = 4950. Practically it is not possible to analyze data this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization of Features\n",
    "\n",
    "It is imperative to mention that a feature set must be normalized before applying PCA. For instance if a feature set has data expressed in units of Kilograms, Light years, or Millions, the variance scale is huge in the training set. If PCA is applied on such a feature set, the resultant loadings for features with high variance will also be large. Hence, principal components will be biased towards features with high variance, leading to false results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numeric data\n",
    "PCA is a statistical technique and can only be applied to numeric data. Therefore, categorical features are required to be converted into numerical features before PCA can be applied."
