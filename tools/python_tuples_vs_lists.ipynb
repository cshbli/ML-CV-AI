    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries are the most widely used built-in data types in Python, which also makes them the best-known data types in Python. When it comes to tuples, grasping the details of how they differ from the lists is not an easy task for the beginners because they are very similar to each other."

    "\n",
    "- Tuples and lists are both used to store collection of data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples and lists are both heterogeneous data types means that you can store any kind of data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples and lists are both ordered means the order in which you put the items are kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples and lists are both sequential data types so you can iterate over the items contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Items of both tuples and lists can be accessed by an integer index operator, provided in square brackets, [index].\n",
    "\n",
    "So…how do they differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The key difference between tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects, lists are mutable. This means that tuples cannot be changed while lists can be modified.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s further understand how this may affect our code in terms of time and memory efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "As lists are mutable, Python needs to allocate an extra memory block in case there is a need to extend the size of the list object after we create it. In contrast, as tuples are immutable and of a fixed size, Python allocates only the minimum memory block required for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, tuples are more memory efficient than lists."
