With CodeGPT we can generate code, explain code, refactor code, and more.

## Setting up CodeGPT on VSCode

To install this extension, we have to open VSCode, go to extensions, and search “Code GPT.” Once we find it, we click on “install”.

You can leave the remaining boxes as is, but in case you want to customize them, keep this in mind:

- Max tokens: Maximum number of tokens you want to get for each request to the API

- Model: Currently there are 3 models available in this extension (text-davinci-003, code-cushman-001 and code-davinci-002). Among these options code-davinci-002 is the most powerful when it comes to coding.

- Temperature: Controls how much randomness is in the output (the lower the temperature, the more likely GPT-3 will choose words with a higher probability of occurrence)
