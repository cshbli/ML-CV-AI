Support for programming languages in VS Code is typically provided through extensions, which can be found in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

1. Kotlin Language comes from developer Mathias Fröhlich, providing Kotlin language support for VS Code — basically a syntax highlighter, Code snippeter, Region code folding for the Kotlin language. 

2. Code Runner: Coming from developer Jun Han, this tool isn’t Kotlin-specific — rather, it lets VS Code users run code snippets or code files coming in 35 different programming languages. Kotlin is the latest addition to that extensive list.
