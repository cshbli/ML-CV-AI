    "The attention mechanism was introduced to improve the performance of the encoder-decoder model for machine translation. The idea behind the attention mechanism was to permit the decoder to utilize the most relevant parts of the input sequence in a flexible manner, by a weighted combination of all the encoded input vectors, with the most relevant vectors being attributed the highest weights.

    "## The Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism was introduced by [Bahdanau et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) to address the bottleneck problem that arises with the use of a fixed-length encoding vector, where the decoder would have limited access to the information provided by the input. This is thought to become especially problematic for long and/or complex sequences, where the dimensionality of their representation would be forced to be the same as for shorter or simpler sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Bahdanau et al.’s attention mechanism is divided into the step-by-step computations of the <b>alignment scores</b>, <b>the weights</b>, and the <b>context vector</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. <b>Alignment scores</b>: The alignment model takes the encoded hidden states, h<sub>i</sub>, and the previous decoder output, S<sub>t-1</sub>, to compute a score, e<sub>t, i</sub>, that indicates how well the elements of the input sequence align with the current output at the position, t. The alignment model is represented by a function, a(.) , which can be implemented by a feedforward neural network:\n",
    "$$e_{t,i}=a(S_{t-1}, h_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. <b>Weights</b>: The weights, $\\alpha_{t,i}$, are computed by applying a softmax operation to the previously computed alignment scores:\n",
    "$$\\alpha_{t,i} = softmax(e_{t,i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. <b>Context vector</b>: A unique context vector, C<sub>t</sub>, is fed into the decoder at each time step. It is computed by a weighted sum of all, T, encoder hidden states:\n",
    "$$C_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\alpha_{t,i}h_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the attention mechanism can be re-formulated into a general form that can be applied to any sequence-to-sequence (abbreviated to seq2seq) task, where the information may not necessarily be related in a sequential fashion. "

    "## The General Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The general attention mechanism makes use of three main components, namely the queries, Q, the keys, K, and the values, V. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to compare these three components to the attention mechanism as proposed by Bahdanau et al., then the query would be analogous to the previous decoder output, S<sub>t-1</sub>, while the values would be analogous to the encoded inputs, h<sub>i</sub>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general attention mechanism then performs the following computations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Each query vector, q = S<sub>t-1</sub>, is matched against a database of keys to compute a score value. This matching operation is computed as the dot product of the specific query under consideration with each key vector, k<sub>i</sub>: \n",
    "$$e_{q,k_i}=q  ^.  k_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. The scores are passed through a softmax operation to generate the weights:\n",
    "$$\\alpha_{q,k_i} = softmax(e_{q,k_i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. The generalized attention is then computed by a weighted sum of the value vectors, V<sub>ki</sub>, where each value vector is paired with a corresponding key:\n",
    "$$attention(q, K, V) = \\sum_i\\alpha_{q,k_i}V_{k_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of machine translation, each word in an input sentence would be attributed its own query, key, and value vectors. These vectors are generated by multiplying the encoder’s representation of the specific word under consideration with three different weight matrices that would have been generated during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, when the generalized attention mechanism is presented with a sequence of words, it takes the query vector attributed to some specific word in the sequence and scores it against each key in the database. In doing so, it captures how the word under consideration relates to the others in the sequence. Then it scales the values according to the attention weights (computed from the scores) to retain focus on those words relevant to the query. In doing so, it produces an attention output for the word under consideration. "
