## What speaks for PyTorch

- PyTorch is easier to learn and work with
- It is better for some projects, especially for NLP and building rapid prototypes
- New resources come in at a rapid pace, offering PyTorch to be suited well for production environments
- Most research is done in PyTorch

## What speaks for TensorFlow

- TFâ€™s documentation is on point and TF offers large community support
- TF is currently better for production models and scalability because it was built to be production ready
- With TF 2.x it basically got most of the Features PyTorch has
- tf.keras offers a high-level API for fast model
