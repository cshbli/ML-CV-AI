## bag of words
A representation of the words in a phrase or passage, irrespective of order. For example, bag of words represents the following three phrases identically:

  * the dog jumps
  * jumps the dog
  * dog jumps the
  
Each word is mapped to an index in a sparse vector, where the vector has an index for every word in the vocabulary. For example, the phrase the dog jumps is mapped into a feature vector with non-zero values at the three indices corresponding to the words the, dog, and jumps. The non-zero value can be any of the following:

  * A 1 to indicate the presence of a word.
  * A count of the number of times a word appears in the bag. For example, if the phrase were <i>the maroon dog is a dog with maroon fur</i>, then both maroon and dog would be represented as 2, while the other words would be represented as 1.
  * Some other value, such as the logarithm of the count of the number of times a word appears in the bag. 
 
## clustering
Grouping related examples, particularly during unsupervised learning. Once all the examples are grouped, a human can optionally supply meaning to each cluster.

Many clustering algorithms exist. For example, the k-means algorithm clusters examples based on their proximity to a centroid, as in the following diagram:

A human researcher could then review the clusters and, for example, label cluster 1 as "dwarf trees" and cluster 2 as "full-size trees."

As another example, consider a clustering algorithm based on an example's distance from a center point, illustrated as follows:
